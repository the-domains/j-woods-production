# Found this really cool website that helps you improvise intentionally. 

<article style=""><h1>Chord Generator (Ab7#9): chord/scale information and play-along backing tracks</h1><p>Of course, Hendrix was able to solo over this chord using the minor pentatonic and blues scale. If you're feeling more adventurous, you could use the the 'reversed' diminished scale, which alternates semitone-wholetone-semitone-wholetone-... for the whole octave. 1 b2 #2 3 #4 5 6 b7</p></article>
